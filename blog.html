                <h1>Industry News: Going 100% Renewable Energy.</h1>
                <h4>Submitted by KD on Thu, 20.08.2015 - 00:00</h4>
                <p>The Renewables 100 Policy Institute discussed 100 percent renewable energy targets in at least one sector during a conference session at Intersolar North America 2015. 
                    100 percent renewable energy covers the following energy demands: electricity power, heating/cooing, and transportation. 
                    Currently, there are 55 cities, 60 regions and 9 utilities across the world that have officially established 100 percent renewable energy goals. 
                    Largely driven by government policies, renewable energy developments have been implemented to gain independence from imported fossil fuels, encourage economic growth, and protect the environment. 
                    The state of Hawaii heavily depends on imported fossil fuels and recently increased its state Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to 100 percent by 2045 from 40 percent by 2030.

                <h1>Cool Tech Mondays: Tandem Solar Cells.</h1>
                <h4>Submitted by KD on Mon, 10.08.2015 - 00:00</h4>
                <p>Solar technology is always evolving. It comes as no surprise that continuing to improve solar efficiency remains a top priority in the industry. 
                    MIT and Stanford University have constructed tandem silicon-perovskite solar cells because they have the potential to increase efficiency. 
                    These multi-junction cells can absorb a larger segment of solar energy due to the increased absorption of photons. 
                    Silicon absorbs photons with a high band gap while perovskite captures photons from lower infrared segment. To learn more about tandem solar cells, click on the link below!

                <h1>Industry News: 10,649 MW Installed in CA.</h1>
                <h4>Submitted by KD on Tue, 28.07.2015 - 00:00</h4>
                <p>The state of California has installed more solar than each of the nations of the UK, France, Spain, Australia, and Belgium. In the first quarter of 2015, 718 MW of solar energy was installed which raised the state's total to 10,649 MW. 
                    This can be divided into three sectors: 231 MW in residential, 88 MW in commercial and 399 MW in utility. 
                    That is quite a feat for a single state! It is no wonder that California continues to be a leader in the clean energy movement.

                <p>Can you guess which state installed the most residential solar in the first three months of 2015?
                    <br><br>
                    How about all 10?
                    <br><br>
                    In any case, congratulations to the US for installing 437 megawatts of residential solar PV and to California leading the installation at 232 megawatts.
                    GTM Research also shares that California's residential market is expected to grow 71% this year. The forecast for 2015 looks bright!

                <p>Solving the problem of energy storage? Yes!
                    <br><br>
                    Tesla's Powerwall stores energy when rates are low and later powers your home at night (when rates are high). 
                    Powerwall has two models: 10kWh weekly cycle, that can keep your home powered for two days without an energy input, or 7kWh daily cycle. 
                    The modernization of this home battery could be a step closer for houses to go off the grid!
